🌐 QNX Neutrino Basics

QNX Neutrino is a microkernel-based RTOS that supports:

    Multithreading

    Message passing

    Pulse events

    Timers

    Custom device drivers (resource managers)


This uses these features to implement:

  A metronome that visually outputs rhythmic patterns based on BPM and time signature.

  A resource manager interface to control this metronome through commands like pause, start, set, etc.


🧠 How It Works: Components & Functionality

1. Multithreaded Resource Manager

   The metronome program is a multi-threaded application:

        Main thread (Resource Manager): Listens for user commands through device I/O (e.g. echo pause 4 > /dev/local/metronome).

        Metronome thread: Uses a QNX interval timer to output patterns at the correct intervals.

2. Device Simulation (/dev/local/metronome)

   QNX lets you write custom resource managers that act like files. Your program registers /dev/local/metronome so that:

        cat, echo, and other standard I/O commands can interact with it.

        You define handlers for I/O functions like io_write() and io_read() to parse and respond to commands.


🧩 Key Features Explained

  🧾 Command Parsing

  Examples:
    
    echo pause 3 > /dev/local/metronome → sends "pause 3" to the resmgr.
  
    cat /dev/local/metronome → triggers a status read from the resource manager.

    The io_write() handler:

    Parses the string

    Recognizes commands like pause, start, stop, set, quit

    Sends pulses or messages to the metronome thread accordingly

🔁 Timer & Output

The metronome thread does:

    Retrieves BPM and time signature values

    Looks up a data table mapping (like |1&2&) for the beat pattern

    Sets up a POSIX timer or uses QNX’s timer_create(), and on every tick:

    Outputs the next character in the rhythm

    Waits the calculated interval:
      
      interval = (60 / BPM) / intervalsPerBeat

⏸️ Pause Functionality

When you echo pause 4 > /dev/local/metronome:

    The resource manager parses this

    Sends a pulse or message to the metronome thread

    The metronome thread pauses its timer or delays output for 4 seconds

    Then resumes on the next beat, not necessarily the next measure

    This uses QNX's MsgSendPulse() or MsgSend() between threads/channels to signal events.

🛑 Start / Stop / Quit

Each command changes the internal state:

    start → starts the timer/output thread

    stop → halts the output but keeps the process alive

    quit → gracefully destroys timers, cancels threads, closes/detaches channels, and exits

📜 Help and Status

Two special device files:

    /dev/local/metronome – supports cat to print current settings (e.g., BPM, time signature, interval timing)

    /dev/local/metronome-help – outputs help text (API documentation)

🧪 Acceptance Tests & QNX Integration

You test the metronome through scripts and terminal input, not GUI.

QNX command-line utilities like cat, echo, pidin are used to interact with your metronome and verify behavior.

Each test shows your metronome's ability to behave like a real-time, responsive system.
